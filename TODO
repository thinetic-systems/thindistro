TODO for pxes images
====================

 * Work on ltspfs:
  http://wiki.ltsp.org/twiki/bin/view/Ltsp/LtspFS 
  http://ltsp.mirrors.tds.net/pub/ltsp/utils/ltsp-server-pkg-debian_0.1_i386.deb
  [DONE] =>  ltspfs working with autofs, goodbye SAMBA

 * Scan local disk if no partitions found and some var is passed from cmdline
   (force_use_local_disk) delete all disk, create swap and ext3 partitions.
   Or use empty space. ASK if windows partition is found and contain data.
   User dialog, from shell scripts. DANGEROUS

 * Scan local disk and use swap if exists or create swap file in ext3 or
   vfat partition. [DONE] => swapon

 * Make a small daemon to sync disk every 30 seconds???

 * Using local disk download (by tftp) squashfs images of other apps
   (download one time, use always) need control version file... to update if needed

 * Create task that depends squashfs modules (example, try to start samba, 
   samba binary not found, download samba.squashfs, mount and start)
   NEED squashfs and unionfs support (very easy) mount / with some modules not probed.

 * Can use cdrom to boot from it ( no need of special networks cards )

 * Admin tags in init scripts ( clean hdd , save config files... )

 * Configure personalized boot options with ip, cmdline, dhcp or both.
